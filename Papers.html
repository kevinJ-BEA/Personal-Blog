                <p class = "paper-desc">Total Canadian merchandise trade reached a record high of nearly $1.2 trillion in 2019. However, after registering two consecutive years of rapid growth, Canada’s merchandise exports and imports both decelerated in 2019. For the full year, Canadian merchandise exports climbed 1.4% to reach $592.6 billion, compared to the 5.7% and 7.0% growth in 2017 and 2018. Similarly, growth in merchandise imports moderated from 5.4% in 2017 and 6.0% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2019. However, because of the faster growth in exports, Canada’s merchandise trade deficit with the world narrowed by $2.9 billion to $8.8 billion, the smallest merchandise trade deficit since 2014.</p>

                <p class = "paper-desc">Total Canadian merchandise trade posted a record high of nearly $1.18 trillion in 2018.Exports increased for the second consecutive year in 2018, registering an all-time high of $584.2 billion, mainly on the back of higher average crude oil prices pushing up total energy exports to the United States. Proportionally, although the United States is still Canada’s largest export destination by far, the trend of slowly diversifying away from the United States continued in 2018, with the share of the U.S. in Canadian exports falling from 75.9% in 2017 to 75.0% in 2018. Imports also grew for the second consecutive year in 2018, reaching an historic level of $595.9 billion. This was led by energy product imports, primarily refined oil from the United States.

                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Canada’s Export Performance Under CETA </h5>
                <p class = "paper-desc">The European Union represents Canada’s second largest merchandise export destination after the United States, accounting for approximately 7.5% of Canadian global merchandise exports over the last five years. On September 21st,  2017, the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), Canada’s most ambitious trade agreement since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), entered into force. <br><br> As of writing, CETA has been in force for almost two years with merchandise trade data available for 21 months. From October 2017 to June 2019, bilateral merchandise trade between Canada and the EU rose 14.6% or $26.3 billion over the equivalent pre‑CETA period (October 2015 to June 2017) to reach $206.6 billion in value. Canada’s merchandise exports to the EU totalled $77.6 billion (up 9.1% or $6.5 billion) and merchandise imports grew by 18.1%. Gold is an important export for Canada to the UK, but it is volatile in value for reasons not related to CETA. Excluding gold, Canada’s exports to the EU advanced 14.0% since CETA came into force.
